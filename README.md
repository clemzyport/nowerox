# Nowerox Nigeria Limited Website

Website was developed with three major things in check from the previous one they once had.

1. Simplicity
2. Authenticity
3. Actual functionality

Using simple website development tools like HTML5 and CSS3, the Nowerox Website was created to showcase the company's profile in its entirety to her prospective clients within and outside the country. Website languages used are HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery and PHP respectively.
